# [Alex's worldle attempt](https://alexpd93.github.io/alex-wordle-attempt/)

This project was set by Founders and Coders as a mock take home challenge. 

## Instructions:
Use your keyboard or click on the buttons to try and guess today's worldle. As it is **worldle** not *wordle* the word is a country üó∫Ô∏è. 

The country list is comprised of countries that don't have a space in them. For example *Papua New Guinea* isn't in the list.

## User stories: 

The user should be able to:

- [x] Visit the website on a publicly accessible domain name. 
- [ ] Browse the game on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
- [ ] See the rules to the game
- [x] See the responsive tile rid. The rows are how many attempts the user has to guess. The columns are how many letters the word has.
- [x] See a keyboard on the screen whose buttons they can press to input into the grid. 
- [x] Press a key on a keyboard. The value of that key is then inputted into the grid. 
- [x] Click or press enter to submit their guess.
