# Alex's worldle attempt 

## User stories: 

The user should be able to visually see if the letter they typed is in the word that needs to be guessed. 

My attempt can be seen [here](https://alexpd93.github.io/alex-wordle-attempt/)

## Issues:
- I haven't been able to make the page very accesible yet. 
- I need to add Javascript so that the letter selected appears in respective tile.
