# Alex's worldle attempt 

## Instructions:
Use your keyboard or click on the buttons to try and guess today's worldle. As it is **worldle** not *wordle* the word is a country 🗺️. 
The country list is comprised of countries that don't have a space in them. For example *Papua New Guinea* isn't in the list.

## User stories: 

The user should be able to visually see if the letter they typed is in the word that needs to be guessed. 

My attempt can be seen [here](https://alexpd93.github.io/alex-wordle-attempt/)

## Issues:
- I haven't been able to make the page very accesible yet. 
- I need to add Javascript so that the letter selected appears in respective tile. 
- I haven't made any instructions so it may not be too clear how to play.
